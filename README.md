# CryptoClustering

In this project we analysed if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
For the analysis we made the elbow chart and scatter plot with both the original data and PCA data.
And we saw that Even after using PCA, we are still getting very similar elbow curve and the K-value is 4. And also by visualizing the crypto Clusters in 2-D we see that after applying PCA, the cluster formation/grouping are much cleaner compared to the original data.
So we can say that it's definetly useful to use fewer features because we still get the same results. And by using fewer features the machine learning algorithm trains faster.
